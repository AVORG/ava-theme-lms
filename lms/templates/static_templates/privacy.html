        NOTICE: On June 1, 2016, AudioVerse Advance adopted an amended Privacy Policy, providing as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
        At AudioVerse Advance, we care about the confidentiality and security of your personal information. We will use commercially reasonable efforts to keep your Personal Information secure in compliance with this Privacy Policy. "Personal Information" is defined below. As used in this Privacy Policy, "we," "us," and "our" refer to AudioVerse Advance.
    </p>
    <p>
        This Privacy Policy only applies to information that we collect through the AudioVerse Advance Website (the "Site," which consists of all content and pages located within the AVAdvance.org web domain) and does not apply to information that we may collect from you in other ways (for example, this policy does not apply to information that you may provide to us over the phone, by fax, or through conventional mail). In addition, please note that your education records are protected by the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act ("FERPA") to the extent FERPA applies.
    </p>
    <h2>USERNAMES AND POSTINGS</h2>
    <p>
        Comments or other information posted by you to our forums, wikis or other areas of the Site designed for public communications or communications among registered class members may be viewed and downloaded by others who visit the Site. For this reason, we encourage you to use discretion when deciding whether to post any information that can be used to identify you to those forums (or other public or classwide areas).
    </p>
    <h2>CONSENT TO PROCESSING OUTSIDE HOME COUNTRY</h2>
    <p>
        By using our Site, or providing information to AudioVerse Advance, you understand and unambiguously consent to the collection, use, disclosure and retention of information in the United States and other countries and territories, for the purposes set forth in this Privacy Policy and the AudioVerse Advance Terms of Service. You hereby consent to the collection, use, disclosure, and retention by AudioVerse Advance of your Personal Information as described under this Privacy Policy, including but not limited to the transfer of your personal data between AudioVerse Advance and the third parties, affiliates, and subsidiaries described in this Privacy Policy. For further certainty, any consent relating to a right to transfer information referred to in this paragraph shall be deemed to include your consent to the transfer of the applicable Personal Information to a jurisdiction which may provide a different level of privacy protection than that available in your own country.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you do not agree with these terms, then please do not access, browse, or register for the Site. If you choose not to provide us with certain information required to provide you with various services offered on our Site, you may not be able to establish a user account and we may not be able to provide you with those services.  
    </p>
    <h2>PERSONAL INFORMATION</h2>
    <p>
        As used in this Privacy Policy, "Personal Information" means any information about yourself that you may provide to us when using the Site, such as when you sign up for a user account or enter into a transaction through the Site, which may include (but is not limited to) your name, contact information, gender, date of birth, occupation, and if you register for an ID Verified Certificate of Achievement, a driver’s license or other government issued identification.
    </p>
    <p>
        We endeavor to limit the collection of Personal Information to what we need with respect to specific Site activities in order to satisfy business, legal, or regulatory requirements. For example, if you wish to purchase an ID Verified Certificate of Achievement, we will collect certain Personal Information necessary to authenticate your identity, as described in greater detail in the AudioVerse Advance Terms of Service. If you do not wish to submit the required authentication information, then you will not be able to purchase a certificate via the Site.
    </p>
    <p>
        AudioVerse does not currently collect financial information from you; however, you will be directed to our third party payment processor; and the submission of your payment information will be subject to the terms found at the payment landing page accessible via AudioVerse Advance Terms of Service.
    </p>
    <h2>INFORMATION WE COLLECT AND HOW WE USE IT</h2>
    <p>
    We collect information, including Personal Information (described above), when you sign up for a user account, participate in online courses, register for a paid course, send us email messages and/or participate in our public forums. We also collect certain usage information about student performance and patterns of learning. In addition, we track information indicating, among other things, which pages of our Site were visited, the order in which they were visited, when they were visited and which hyperlinks and other user interface controls were used.
    </p>
    <p>
    We may log the IP address, operating system, and browser software used by each user of the Site, and we may be able to determine from an IP address a user's Internet Service Provider and the geographic location of his or her point of connectivity. Various web analytics tools are used to collect this information. Some of the information is collected through cookies (small text files placed on your computer that store information about you, which can be accessed by the Site). You should be able to control how and whether cookies will be accepted by your web browser. Most browsers offer instructions on how to reset the browser to reject cookies in the "Help" section of the toolbar. If you reject our cookies, many functions and conveniences of this Site may not work properly.
    </p>
    <h2>USE AND DISCLOSURE TO THIRD PARTIES</h2>
    <p>
    Among other things, we and the educational institutions and other members that provide courses through AudioVerse Advance (the "Members") may use the information about you collected through the Site (including your Personal Information) in connection with the following. In cases where we share or disclose your Personal Information: (1) the third party recipients are required to handle the Personal Information in a confidential manner and to maintain adequate security to protect the information from loss, misuse, unauthorized access or disclosure, alteration, and destruction; and (2) we will only disclose and share the Personal Information that is required by the third party to fulfill the purpose stated at the time of collection.

        </ul>
    </div>
    <h2>USE FOR PERSONALIZATION AND PEDAGOGICAL IMPROVEMENTS</h2>

    <p>Our goal is to provide current and future visitors with the best possible educational experience. To further this goal, we may present different users with different versions of course materials and software. We do this to personalize the experience to the individual learner (assess the learner's level of ability and learning style, and present materials best suited to the learner), to evaluate the effectiveness of our course materials, to improve our understanding of the learning process and to otherwise improve the effectiveness of our offerings. We may publish or otherwise publicize results from this process, but, unless otherwise permitted under this Privacy Policy, those publications or public disclosures will not include Personal Information.</p>

    <h2>LINKS TO OTHER WEBSITES</h2>

    <p>The Site contains links to websites published by third parties, including other content providers as well as certain service providers, such as those who process payments on behalf of AudioVerse Advance. These other websites are not under our control, and you acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible for the collection and use of your information by such websites, unless we have otherwise indicated in this Privacy Policy. We encourage you to be aware when you are be redirected to a third party website and review the privacy policies of each website you visit and use.</p>

    <h2>SECURITY</h2>

    <p>AudioVerse Advance has a program designed to protect Personal Information in its possession or control. This is done through a variety of privacy and security policies, processes, and procedures, including administrative, physical, and technical safeguards that reasonably and appropriately protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the Personal Information that it creates, receives, maintains, or transmits. Nonetheless, no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage, is 100% secure; and therefore, AudioVerse Advance cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
